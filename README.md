# Color Cleaver - Back End

### Introduction

This app will tell you what secondary color comes from two primary colors, as well as what primary colors make up a secondary.

You don't really need to know your color wheel. Google is there, but also: the tests will just tell you what strings they expect!


### Setup

Fork, clone, run `jest --watch-all`, and code until your face turns blue or your tests turn green. Whichever comes first!

Fork and clone.
Add two files, color-combinator.js and color-deconstructor.js.
In each one, create a function (you actually don't have to name it as we did in the tests, though you certainly can!).
In each file, export the function using module.exports = and the name of your function.
Back in your terminal, run jest --watch-all, and code until your face turns blue or your tests turn green. Whichever comes first!
